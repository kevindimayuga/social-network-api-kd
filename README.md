# Social Network API

![License](https://img.shields.io/badge/license-MIT-blue)

M18 - This repo is a Social Network API that social networks can use for their users to share their thoughts, react to friends' thoughts and create friends lists.

## Description

The challenge is an Job-seeking coding assessment or take-home assignment (no starter code is provided, we will build this web application by scratch). The goal is to build an API for a social network web application where users can share their thoughts, react to friends’ thoughts, and create a friend list. I used Express.js for routing, a MongoDB database, and the Mongoose ODM. In addition to using the Express.js and Mongoose packages, I used moment.js to format date timestamps. I also used Insomnia Core to test the API routes.

The motivation behind this project is to create an API for a social network using the mentioned packages, tools, and technologies. The purpose of this project is to build the backend of a social network web application where users can share their thoughts, react to friends’ thoughts, and create a friend list. The user story and acceptance criteria are as follows:
